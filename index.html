                    <h2>Hello!</h2>
                    <h2>I'm Roger Aponte!</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to my portfolio. These are a few of the projects that I have worked on and previous work
                        history.</p>

                    <p>Product Zone Specialist, Apple Inc.—2014-2019
                        I was a product zone specialist for almost 5 years before moving into the current role I am in
                        now. With this role I
                        learned many things that currently help me today. Aligning with the customer, listening to the
                        customer and ulti-
                        mately finding the right solution for them. In a world of many options, this role helped me see
                        how to effectively
                        see the right path for each and every customer, regardless of how different each journey was.
                    </p>

                    Technical Specialist, Apple Inc.—2019-2020
                    In this role, I have the pleasure of repairing not only devices, but relationships as well. From
                    troubleshooting de-
                    vices to educational opportunities, these are a few things that my role provide for the customer. In
                    terms of trou-
                    bleshooting, I make sure that throughout the entire process the customer is aware of what I am doing
                    and what
                    outcomes can occur. In terms of education, I provide useful tools and practices to make sure that
                    the customer
                    stays aware of how they can easily correct any issues that may come their way.</p>
                    Technical Expert, Apple Inc—2020-2021
                    In my current role, I have the same responsibilities as my last role, but now I have the opportunity
                    to repair de-
                    vices and replace parts that have either failed or have been damaged over time. My repairs include
                    replacing
                    displays, batteries, cameras, etc. After repairs, diagnostics are a big part of the process to
                    ensure that the repair
                    was performed correctly. Being a mentor and a key team player also plays a big role in this
                    position.</p>
                    OneBlood- 2021-2022
                    In my previous role, I dealt with the manufacturing of blood and blood products. From extracting
                    components to
                    the blood prepping, I surveyed and was responsible of getting these products ready to be sent out to
                    different
                    locations. The main take aways I’ve acquired from working at my role is improving time management,
                    working
                    with a close knit team and having better attention to detail.</p>
                    Suncoast Credit Union 2023-Current
                    In my current role, I am responsible for accurately calculating transactions, educating and
                    providing the best cus-
                    tomer service to the members of the credit union. From simple deposits and withdraws, to explaining
                    the various
                    details of loans and credit cards. Providing members with educational opportunities with every
                    transaction and
                    more ways on how to keep their information secure. In this role, I have learned the importance of
                    confidentiality,
                    teamwork and above all furthering personal and member education.</p>
