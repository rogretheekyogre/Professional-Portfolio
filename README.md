# Professional-Portfolio
## This project entails a look into my personal portfolio.

In this project I created a portfolio using HTML and CSS to create 
the layout and styling for the page. I was assisted by my tutor,AskBCS and 
online resources.
Per the assignment requirements, I applied buttons to go to diffrent pages,
made my first application clickable through a photo and showed various
sizing options.
